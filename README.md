# MATLAB-SCREENSHOT


**MATLAB** is a high- performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming environment. Furthermore, MATLAB is a modern programming language environment: it has sophisticated data structures, contains built-in editing and debugging tools, and supports object-oriented programming.

ADVANTAGES OF MATLAB:
1. Easy to use.
2. Platform Independence.
3. Predefined Functions.
4. Device- Independent Plotting.
5. Graphical User Interface.
6. MATLAB Compiler.

DISADVANTAGES OF MATLAB:
1. MATLAB is based on an interpreted language and it may execute slower than compiled programs.
2. A full copy of MATLAB is 5 to 10 times more expensive than a C/C++/Fortran compiler.

THE M FILES MATLAB allows writing two kinds of program files âˆ’
1. SCRIPTS: Script files are program files with .m extension. In these files, you write series of commands, which you want to execute together. Scripts do not accept inputs and do not return any outputs. They operate on data in the workspace.
2.FUNCTIONS: Functions files are also program files with .m extension. Functions can accept inputs and return outputs. Internal variables are local to the function.


SOME FUNCTIONS USED IN THE CODE:
1. JAVA.AWT.ROBOT: Java.awt.Robot class is used to take the control of mouse and keyboard. Once you get the control, you can do any type of operation related to mouse and keyboard through your java code . This class is used generally for test automation.

2. JAVA.AWT.RECTANGLE: A rectangle specifies an area in a coordinate space that is defined by the rectangle's top-left point (x, y) in the coordinate space, its width, and its height. A rectangle's width and height are public fields.

3. JAVA.AWT.TOOLKIT: Toolkit class is the abstract superclass of every implementation in the Abstract Window Toolkit. Subclasses of Toolkit are used to bind various components. It inherits Object class.

DESCRIPTION: The Code allow the user to take the Screenshot of the Editor Window.For Detailed Code Refer SCREENSHOT.m File
